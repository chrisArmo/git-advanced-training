When a vessel containing a troubled soul perishes, they may drift between realms.
As a spectral entity they can linger and haunt subtly with no recollection of prior existence.
It's a magically melancholic phenomena.
When the spectres roam, howling ghastly things in the night, it can cause the skin to crawl.

There's something hauntingly beautiful about death with the aura of immense love.
The way a container fades as the soul slips away into the after as grand admiration and care perpetuates on forever.
It's a little sad, it may tug at heart strings relentlessly, but it's marvelous in opinion.

Ghosts that mutate negatively become demons, nefarious in nature, hideous forces of putrid evil.
An unsavory passing and/or grudge can cause this to happen.
